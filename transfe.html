                    <p>After leaving the Chinese league for a year and a
                      half, the Belgian striker returns to Atletico Madrid on loan in the winter market and
                      signs for four years this 2020/2021 season.</p>
                      <p>Atlético Madrid have announced another signing (somewhat), as the club made official
                         Yannick Carrasco’s return on a permanent deal from Dalian Pro. No transfer fee has been
                         mentioned to this point.</p>
                         <p>The 27-year-old jetted back to the Spanish capital from international duty with Belgium
                            to complete the deal, and he’s now back in training with his teammates, linked to the club
                            through 2024.</p>
                            <p>Carrasco was an absolute star in the Chinese Super League after his transfer there in 2018,
                               and he came back to Atlético on loan in a surprise deadline day move this past January. He was
                               key in helping the team secure third place and registered one goal with four assists over 16 games.</p>
                               <p>Any issues the winger may have had with Diego Simeone apparently have been worked out, and he always
                                  maintained that he wanted to stay following his return from China. Atlético always were keen on extending
                                  his stay in Madrid, too. He looks set to become an important part of Simeone’s plans again, as his ability
                                  to unbalance a defense through his speed and dribbling isn’t really replicated elsewhere in the squad.</p>
                                  <p>Carrasco initially signed for Atlético from Monaco in 2015, and he has scored 24 goals while handing out
                                     21 assists across his 140 appearances as a colchonero.</p>
