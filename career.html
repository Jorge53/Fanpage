                                        <p>Carrasco joined Monaco from Belgian club Genk in 2010 . He made his professional debut on 30 July 2012 in the opening game of the Ligue 2
                                          season against Tours, opening a 4–0 victory at the Stade Louis II via a free kick. On 13 April 2013, he scored both goals of a 2–0 league
                                           victory over Auxerre. In his debut campaign with the club, he appeared in 27 games and scored 6 goals as Monaco won promotion back to Ligue 1.</p>
                                        <p> His first top-flight goal came on 5 October 2013 against Saint-Étienne, converting a James Rodríguez cross and helping Monaco to a 2–1 victory.
                                          He scored twice in the opening 10 minutes fifteen days later as Monaco drew 2–2 away to Sochaux; the team finished their first season back
                                          at the top as runners up to Paris Saint-Germain.</p>
                                        <p>On 25 February 2015, he scored the last goal of Monaco's 3–1 away win at Arsenal in the last 16 first leg of the UEFA Champions League, after
                                        replacing Dimitar Berbatov in the 75th minute.</p>
                                      <p>On 10 July 2015, Atlético Madrid announced the signing of Carrasco on a five-year deal for a reported fee of €20 million. On 18 October,
                                       he scored his first goal for Atletico in a 2–0 away victory over Real Sociedad.</p>
                                  <p>   On 28 May 2016, as a half-time replacement for Augusto Fernández in the 2016 UEFA Champions League Final at the San Siro, Carrasco scored Atlético's
                                      79th-minute equaliser against Real Madrid; his team lost in a penalty shoot-out. He was the first Belgian to score in a European Cup final. </p>
                                    <p>On 15 October 2016, he scored his first professional hat-trick in a 7–1 rout of Granada CF.</p>
                                <p>  On 26 February 2018, along with teammate Nicolás Gaitán, Carrasco moved to Chinese Super League newcomers Dalian Yifang (later rebranded as Dalian
                                   Professional), a club owned by Atléti's partial owner Dalian Wanda Group.[citation needed] He made his debut on 3 March in an 8–0 loss to Shanghai
                                   SIPG, and scored his first goal in his fourth match for the club on 31 March, in a 1–1 away draw with Henan Jianye, ending his club's season-opening
                                   three-game losing streak.</p>
                                 <p>On 31 January 2020, Carrasco returned to Atlético Madrid on loan until the end of the season. On 8 September 2020, he rejoined the club on a permanent
                                  basis, signing a four-year contract.</p>
