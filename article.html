                    <p>
                    Yannick Ferreira Carrasco, born 4 September 1993, is a Belgian footballer who plays as a Left or right midfielder for Spanish club Atlético
                    Madrid and as a winger or midfielder for the Belgium national team.
                    He began his career with Monaco, where he scored 20 goals in 105 professional games, winning Ligue 2 in his first season and finishing
                    runner-up in Ligue 1 in the second. In 2015, he joined La Liga side Atlético Madrid for a reported €20 million, scoring in the final as
                    they were runners-up in the UEFA Champions League. After a two-year spell with Dalian Professional in the Chinese Super League, Carrasco
                    returned to Atlético in early 2020 on a loan basis. In September 2020 it was announced that Carrasco would officially transfer to Atletico
                    on a permanent basis and would sign a contract for four years.
                      Carrasco made his international debut in April 2015. He played at UEFA Euro 2016 and was part of their squad that came third at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. </p>

                    <p> Carrasco was born in Vilvoorde to a Portuguese father and Spanish mother. His father left the family when Yannick was still a child,
                       leaving his mother, Carmen, to raise him and his brother Mylan. He has two younger half-siblings, Hugo and Celia. While initially known
                        as "Ferreira Carrasco" at the time of his professional debut, he later chose to drop the paternal part of his Spanish-style double surname.

In 2017, Carrasco married former Miss Belgium Noémie Happart.
